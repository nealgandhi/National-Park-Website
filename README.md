## Synopsis

This website is made to let you search through a list of parks with an active search bar and provides information on the park itself. You can also add the parks to a watch list that makes all of the non-streaming images available on a different page. The other filter is being able to view a list of parks based on the activity you select. Each activity button, on click, displays a list of parks with that specific activity available.

## Challenge

I started this project the day the initial email came out and I knew that I would have to learn a lot to be able to submit a properly designed website with the aesthetics that I wanted to have. This was my first real time working with React.js, and this is where my main challenge came from. The learning hurdle took me a few weeks to understand, but slowly I understood more and more on how to make a fluid website that has both functionality and aesthetics.

## Tools used

I mainly used the React.js framework for the backend of my website and used their innate tools to allow me to fetch data from the API and display different components on different webpages. To style, I used Material-UI and used the button component to let my buttons display in a nicer manor.
